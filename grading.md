# Instructor comments

1. Use numpy instead of math when using arrays. All functions in numpy are automatically vectorized, as are basic numerical operations. No need to call vectorize explicitly if the operations are already vectorized (in fact, that may make the code slower).
1. You did not actually do the notebook portion of the assignment. Did you forget to push?
